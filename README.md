# Augmented Audio (AUMA) Framework Demo

This is a simple demonstration of the Augmented Audio (AUMA) framework. Augmented audio is an open source framework that provides illustrated and interactive audio content. Aumaâ€™s lightweight and accessible design allows it to offer eLearning to marginalized, often illiterate populations with limited access to technology. It runs both on smartphones and smart feature phones.

The demo shows the combination of audio with illustrations and simple interactions.
